📞 Instagram Auto Phone & Email Capture Extension
A lightweight Chrome extension that automatically captures phone numbers and email IDs from Instagram Web DMs, copies the latest phone number to your clipboard, and displays all captured data in a clean, organized table.
Designed for speed, accuracy, and minimal effort.

- Ready to paste instantly using Ctrl + V

**🔹 Email ID Capture (Secondary)**

**🔹 Clean, Unified Table View**
- Single table with four columns:

  - Phone and email entries are shown in separate rows
  - No duplicate email entries

**🔹 Keyboard Shortcut Toggle**

**🧩 How It Works (User Perspective)**
- Open Instagram Web
  👉 https://www.instagram.com
- Open any Direct Message (DM) conversation
- When someone sends:
  - A phone number → it is instantly copied to your clipboard
  - An email ID → it is saved and listed
- Open the extension popup to:
  - View captured phone numbers and emails
  - Manually copy any entry
  - Enable or disable the extension

**🔄 Auto-Copy Behavior (Important)**
- Every detected phone number is copied immediately
- This happens even if the number was captured earlier
- Email IDs are never auto-copied (manual copy only)

This ensures the clipboard always contains the most recent phone number.

**🧠 Data Organization Rules**
- Phone Numbers
  - One row per phone number
  - Duplicates are avoided in the list
  - Auto-copied when detected
- Email IDs
  - One email per Instagram user
  - Stored and shown only once
  - Displayed in a separate row
- No data is uploaded anywhere
  - All data stays inside your browser
  - Stored using Chrome’s local storage
